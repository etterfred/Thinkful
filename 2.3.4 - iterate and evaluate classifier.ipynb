    "## Summary of this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "### This notebook uses the Naive Bayes method to predict if a message on Amazon is positive.  Comparisons were made with imdb data and yelp data to testing various features.\n",
    "### Questions:\n",
    "1.  Do any of your classifiers seem to overfit?\n",
    "    - yes, my accuracy went from 276 (mislabeled) to 292 (with imdb) to 320 (with yelp).  The data I studied the most to pick out classifiers was amazon, followed by imdb which is probably why my accuracy was better in those two data sets.  I was fitting the classifiers perhaps too closely to that data and wasn't as accurate for the yelp data.\n",
    "2.  Which seem to perform the best? Why?\n",
    "    - I tried to add many different words from the data and they all seemed to help a little.\n",
    "    - adding a 'not' column and then making this boolean value its opposite worked well. \n",
    "3.  Which features seemed to be most impactful to performance?\n",
    "    - adding an exclamation point to predict positive reviews created more mislabeled points. (went from 276 to 291) \n"

From the confusion matrix, only 16 false positives doesn't seem too bad.  Most improvement to the model can be found by decreasing the number of false negatives - in other words finding better features to identify a positive review."

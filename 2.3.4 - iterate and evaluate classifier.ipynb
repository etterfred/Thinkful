    "## Summary of this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "### This notebook uses the Naive Bayes method to predict if a message on Amazon is positive.  Comparisons were made with imdb data and yelp data to test various features.\n",
    "### Questions:\n",
    "1.  Do any of your classifiers seem to overfit?\n",
    "    - yes, my accuracy went from 276 (mislabeled) to 292 (with imdb) to 320 (with yelp).  The data I studied the most to pick out classifiers was amazon, followed by imdb which is probably why my accuracy was better in those two data sets.  I was fitting the classifiers perhaps too closely to that data and wasn't as accurate for the yelp data.\n",
    "2.  Which seem to perform the best? Why?\n",
    "    - I tried to add many different words from the data and they all seemed to help a little.\n",
    "    - adding a **'not'** column and then making this boolean value its opposite worked well. \n",
    "3.  Which features seemed to be most impactful to performance?\n",
    "    - adding an exclamation point to predict positive reviews created more mislabeled points. (went from 276 to 291) \n"

    "- The number of mislabeled points out of 1000 is **266** so far.  Adding a 'waste' feature did not improve or change results at all.  From the confusion matrix, only 19 false positives (for **amazon**) doesn't seem too bad.  Most improvement to the model can be found by decreasing the number of false negatives - in other words finding better features to identify a positive review.  The accuracy is (1 - 266/1000) or **0.734**; however just guessing all positive or all negative would yield an accuracy of 0.50 since there are 500 positive and 500 negative reviews total.\n",
    "- Accuracy for **IMDB** was (1 - 284/748) = **0.62** compared to 386/748 or **0.52** for just guessing positive for all.  Probably some overfitting going on here.\n",
    "- Accuracy for **Yelp** was (1 - 306/1000) = **0.69** compared to **0.50** for just guessing positive."
